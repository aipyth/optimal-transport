    "The idea of optimal transport is to find a transportation plan $\\pi$ from two probability\n",
    "measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ defined on the spaces $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\n",
    "This transportation plan should be the most economical one.\n",
    "To express that is math, we define the cost function $c$\n",
    "(in discrete case it is just a matrix). This way the cost of transporting the mass\n",
    "from a point $x \\in X$ to $y \\in Y$ has the cost $c(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several formulations of the Optimal Transport problem.\n",

    "Computationally, it may be hard to work with this Kantorovich formulation\n",
